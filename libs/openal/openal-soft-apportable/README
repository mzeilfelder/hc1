This is an OpenAL-soft shared library for Android.

Features:
 * builds for Froyo or later
 * builds as a shared library
 * back-end for AudioTrack or OpenSLES
 * Fixed-point (default) or floating-point math for mixing

Created with:
android create project --target android-8 --name openal_soft --path openal-soft --activity openal_soft --package com.apportable.openal_soft 

Fork of OpenAL-soft in jni/OpenAL

Build with:
cd jni
ndk-build



Additional Build Notes:
The build process supports multiple options.
This is an example incantation to build for ALmixer.
ndk-build V=1 POST_FROYO=yes MAX_SOURCES_LOW=32 MAX_SOURCES_START=32 MAX_SOURCES_HIGH=32 TARGET_PLATFORM=android-19

By default, armeabi armeabi-v7a x86, are built. You can override this by passing a specific arch via:
TARGET_ARCH_ABI=armeabi-v7a
e.g.
ndk-build V=1 POST_FROYO=yes MAX_SOURCES_LOW=32 MAX_SOURCES_START=32 MAX_SOURCES_HIGH=32 TARGET_PLATFORM=android-19 TARGET_ARCH_ABI=armeabi-v7a
You may also modify the APP_ABI in the Application.mk directly.


V=1 is verbose mode. This is recommended so you can visually verify the correct flags are set.

POST_FROYO=yes is needed to build the OpenSL ES backend (2.3+). 

MAX_SOURCES_LOW, MAX_SOURCES_START, MAX_SOURCES_HIGH are features introduced by Apportable to dynamically scale the number of sources based on CPU load. 
Many libraries that preallocate sources and recycle them will have problems with this, so for these cases, you should set all the numbers the same so the number stays constant.

TARGET_PLATFORM=android-9 or greater is needed for OpenSL ES.

armeabi and armeabi-v7a builds use Apportable's fixed point modifications to OpenAL-Soft (but x86 does not).
Fixed point is a clear performance winner for armeabi. But no benchmarks have been done to determine if fixed point or floating point is better on armeabi-v7a.
Benchmarks are welcome.
