/** Example 006 2D Graphics

This tutorial shows how to do 2d graphics with the Irrlicht Engine.
It shows how to draw images, keycolor based sprites,
transparent rectangles, and different fonts. You may consider
this useful if you want to make a 2d game with the engine, or if
you want to draw a cool interface or head up display for your 3d game.

As always, I include the header files, use the irr namespace,
and tell the linker to link with the .lib file.

	load this texture and tell the engine, which part of it should be
	transparent based on a colorkey.

	In this example, we don't tell it the color directly, we just say "Hey
	Irrlicht Engine, you'll find the color I want at position (0,0) on the
	texture.". Instead, it would be also possible to call
	driver->makeColorKeyTexture(images, video::SColor(0,0,0,0)), to make
	e.g. all black pixels transparent. Please note that
