/** Example 007 Collision

We will describe 2 methods: Automatic collision detection for moving through
3d worlds with stair climbing and sliding, and manual scene node and triangle
picking using a ray.  In this case, we will use a ray coming out from the
camera, but you can use any ray.

To start, we take the program from tutorial 2, which loads and displays a
quake 3 level. We will use the level to walk in it and to pick triangles from.
In addition we'll place 3 animated models into it for triangle picking. The
following code starts up the engine and loads the level, as per tutorial 2.

	We add a first person shooter camera to the scene so that we can see and
	move in the quake 3 level like in tutorial 2. But this, time, we add a
	special animator to the camera: A collision response animator. This
	animator modifies the scene node to which it is attached in order to
	prevent it from moving through walls and to add gravity to the node. The
	only things we have to tell the animator is how the world looks like,
	how big the scene node is, how much gravity to apply and so on. After the
	collision response animator is attached to the camera, we do not have to do
	anything else for collision detection, it's all done automatically.
	The rest of the collision detection code below is for picking. And please
	note another cool feature: The collision response animator can be
	attached also to all other scene nodes, not only to cameras. And it can
	be mixed with other scene node animators. In this way, collision
	detection and response in the Irrlicht engine is really easy.

	Now we'll take a closer look on the parameters of
	createCollisionResponseAnimator(). The first parameter is the
	TriangleSelector, which specifies how the world, against which collision
	detection is done, looks like. The second parameter is the scene node,
	which is the object which is affected by collision detection - in our
	case it is the camera. The third defines how big the object is, it is
	the radius of an ellipsoid. Try it out and change the radius to smaller
	values, the camera will be able to move closer to walls after this. The
	next parameter is the direction and speed of gravity.  We'll set it to
	(0, -1000, 0), which approximates realistic gravity (depends on the units 
	which are used in the scene model). You could set it to (0,0,0) to disable 
	gravity. And the last value is just an offset: Without it the ellipsoid with 
	which collision detection is done would be around the camera and the camera 
	would be in the middle of the ellipsoid. But as human beings, we are used to 
	have our eyes on top of the body, not in the middle of it. So we place the 
	scene node 50 units over the center of the ellipsoid with this parameter. 
	And that's it, collision detection works now.
