/** Example 003 Custom SceneNode

This tutorial is more advanced than the previous ones.
If you are currently just playing around with the Irrlicht
engine, you may want to look at other examples first.
This tutorials shows how to create a custom scene node and
how to use it in the engine. A custom scene node is needed
if you want to implement a render technique the Irrlicht
Engine currently does not support. For example, you can write
an indoor portal based renderer or an advanced terrain scene
node with it. By creating custom scene nodes, you can
easily extend the Irrlicht Engine and adapt it to your needs.

I will keep the tutorial simple: Keep everything very short 
and  everything in one .cpp file. This is the style which 
will also be used in most of the following tutorials.

To start, I include the header files, use the irr namespace,
and tell the linker to link with the .lib file.

/*
Here comes the more sophisticated part of this tutorial:
The class of our very own custom scene node. To keep it simple,
our scene node will not be an indoor portal renderer nor a terrain
scene node, but a simple tetrahedron, a 3D object consisting of 4
connected vertices, which only draws itself and does nothing more.
Note that this scenario does not require a custom scene node in Irrlicht.
Instead one would create a mesh from the geometry and pass it to a
irr::scene::IMeshSceneNode. This example just illustrates creation of a custom
scene node in a simple setting.

To allow our scene node to be inserted into the Irrlicht
Engine scene, the class we create needs to be derived from the
irr::scene::ISceneNode class and has to override some methods.

	when it should call irr::scene::ISceneNode::render(). For
	example, normal scene nodes render their content one after another,
	while stencil buffer shadows would like to be drawn after all other
	scene nodes. And camera or light scene nodes need to be rendered before
	all other scene nodes (if at all). So here we simply register the
	scene node to render normally. If we would like to let it be rendered
	like cameras or light, we would have to call
	SceneManager->registerNodeForRendering(this, SNRT_LIGHT_AND_CAMERA);
