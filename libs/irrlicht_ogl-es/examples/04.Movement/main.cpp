/** Example 004 Movement

This tutorial shows how to move and animate SceneNodes. The
basic concept of SceneNodeAnimators is shown as well as manual
movement of nodes using the keyboard.  We'll demonstrate framerate
independent movement, which means moving by an amount dependent
on the duration of the last run of the Irrlicht loop.

Example 19.MouseAndJoystick shows how to handle other input than keyboard.

As always, include the header files, use the irr namespace,
and tell the linker to link with the .lib file.
