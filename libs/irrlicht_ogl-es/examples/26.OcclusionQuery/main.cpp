/** Example 026 OcclusionQuery

This tutorial shows how to speed up rendering by use of the
OcclusionQuery feature. The usual rendering tries to avoid rendering of
scene nodes by culling those nodes which are outside the visible area, the
view frustum. However, this technique does not cope with occluded objects
which are still in the line of sight, but occluded by some larger object
between the object and the eye (camera). Occlusion queries check exactly that.
The queries basically measure the number of pixels that a previous render
left on the screen.
Since those pixels cannot be recognized at the end of a rendering anymore,
the pixel count is measured directly when rendering. Thus, one needs to render
the occluder (the object in front) first. This object needs to write to the
z-buffer in order to become a real occluder. Then the node is rendered and in
case a z-pass happens, i.e. the pixel is written to the framebuffer, the pixel
is counted in the query.
The result of a query is the number of pixels which got through. One can, based
on this number, judge if the scene node is visible enough to be rendered, or if
the node should be removed in the next round. Also note that the number of
pixels is a safe over approximation in general. The pixels might be overdrawn
later on, and the GPU tries to avoid inaccuracies which could lead to false
negatives in the queries.

As you might have recognized already, we had to render the node to get the
numbers. So where's the benefit, you might say. There are several ways where
occlusion queries can help. It is often a good idea to just render the bbox
of the node instead of the actual mesh. This is really fast and is a safe over
approximation. If you need a more exact render with the actual geometry, it's
a good idea to render with just basic solid material. Avoid complex shaders
and state changes through textures. There's no need while just doing the
occlusion query. At least if the render is not used for the actual scene. This
is the third way to optimize occlusion queries. Just check the queries every
5th or 10th frame, or even less frequent. This depends on the movement speed
of the objects and camera.
