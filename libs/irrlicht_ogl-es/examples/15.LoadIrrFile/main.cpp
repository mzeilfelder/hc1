/** Example 015 Loading Scenes from .irr Files

Since version 1.1, Irrlicht is able to save and load
the full scene graph into an .irr file, an xml based
format. There is an editor available to edit
those files, named irrEdit (http://www.ambiera.com/irredit)
which can also be used as world and particle editor.
This tutorial shows how to use .irr files.

Lets start: Create an Irrlicht device and setup the window.

	this example simple, we are simply loading the scene here. See the

	- When passing a custom parent node to loadScene then irr_scene attributes will be passed to that.
	  Usually not a problem, but for example AmbientLight will not change that way unless you create a custom 
	  SceneNode type which can interpret those attributes.
