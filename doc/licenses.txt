***
H-Craft Championship media
***
The media is restricted and may not be distributed, changed or used in other products than H-Craft Championship.
We allow people to use it privately, but any kind of re-distribution is forbidden.
This will likely never change as a lot of media is based on licenses which won't allow us to liberate the media any further.

There are the following exceptions to that:
The font Andika is using the open font license which can be found at: media/ui/andika/OFL.txt

The songs 2'25'31 and Dream on from Manolo Camp are under a creative commons license. See media/sounds/music_level/license.txt
Or contact the music author at http://www.manolocamp.net/
